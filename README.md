Module test
Question 1
The format_address function separates out parts of the address string into new strings: house_number and street_name, and returns: "house number X on street named Y". The format of the input string is: numeric house number, followed by the street name which may contain numbers, but never by themselves, and could be several words long. For example, "123 Main Street", "1001 1st Ave", or "55 North Center Drive". Fill in the gaps to complete this function.

Question 2
The highlight_word function changes the given word in a sentence to its upper-case version. For example, highlight_word("Have a nice day", "nice") returns "Have a NICE day". Can you write this function in just one line?

Question 3
A professor with two assistants, Jamie and Drew, wants an attendance list of the students, in the order that they arrived in the classroom. Drew was the first one to note which students arrived, and then Jamie took over. After the class, they each entered their lists into the computer and emailed them to the professor, who needs to combine them into one, in the order of each student's arrival. Jamie emailed a follow-up, saying that her list is in reverse order. Complete the steps to combine them into one list as follows: the contents of Drew's list, followed by Jamie's list in reverse order, to get an accurate list of the students as they arrived.

Question 4
Use a list comprehension to create a list of squared numbers (n*n). The function receives the variables start and end, and returns a list of squares of consecutive numbers between start and end inclusively.
For example, squares(2, 3) should return [4, 9].

Question 5
Complete the code to iterate through the keys and values of the car_prices dictionary, printing out some information about each one.

Question 6
Taylor and Rory are hosting a party. They sent out invitations, and each one collected responses into dictionaries, with names of their friends and how many guests each friend is bringing. Each dictionary is a partial list, but Rory's list has more current information about the number of guests. Fill in the blanks to combine both dictionaries into one, with each friend listed only once, and the number of guests from Rory's dictionary taking precedence, if a name is included in both dictionaries. Then print the resulting dictionary.

Question 7
Use a dictionary to count the frequency of letters in the input string. Only letters should be counted, not blank spaces, numbers, or punctuation. Upper case should be considered the same as lower case. For example, count_letters("This is a sentence.") should return {'t': 2, 'h': 1, 'i': 2, 's': 3, 'a': 1, 'e': 3, 'n': 2, 'c': 1}.


WEEK 5 - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Quiz 1
Question 2
Creating new instances of class objects can be a great way to keep track of values using attributes associated with the object. The values of these attributes can be easily changed at the object level.  The following code illustrates a famous quote by George Bernard Shaw, using objects to represent people. Fill in the blanks to make the code satisfy the behavior described in the quote.

Question 3
The City class has the following attributes: name, country (where the city is located), elevation (measured in meters), and population (approximate, according to recent statistics). Fill in the blanks of the max_elevation_city function to return the name of the city and its country (separated by a comma), when comparing the 3 defined instances for a specified minimal population. For example, calling the function for a minimum population of 1 million: max_elevation_city(1000000) should return "Sofia, Bulgaria".

Question 5
We have two pieces of furniture: a brown wood table and a red leather couch. Fill in the blanks following the creation of each Furniture class instance, so that the describe_furniture function can format a sentence that describes these pieces as follows: "This piece of furniture is made of {color} {material}"
